After 24 weeks, sitagliptin reduced HbA 1c by 0.74% (p < 0.001) relative to placebo. In the subset of patients on glimepiride plus metformin, sitagliptin reduced HbA 1c by 0.89% relative to placebo, compared with a reduction of 0.57% in the subset of patients on gli- 
mepiride alone. The addition of sitagliptin reduced FPG by 20.1 mg/dl (p < 0.001) and increased homeostasis 
model assessment-b, a marker of b-cell function, by 12% (p < 0.05) relative to placebo. In patients who underwent 
a meal tolerance test (n ¼ 134), sitagliptin decreased 2-h post-prandial glucose (PPG) by 36.1 mg/dl (p < 0.001) rel- ative to placebo. The addition of sitagliptin was generally well tolerated, although there was a higher incidence of 
overall (60 vs. 47%) and drug-related adverse experiences (AEs) (15 vs. 7%) in the sitagliptin group than in the pla- cebo group. This was largely because of a higher incidence of hypoglycaemia AEs (12 vs. 2%, respectively) in the 
sitagliptin group compared with the placebo group. Body weight modestly increased with sitagliptin relative to pla- cebo (þ0.8 vs. À0.4 kg; p < 0.001).</b> Conclusions: Sitagliptin 100 mg once
The primary efficacy parameter was mean change from baseline in HbA 1c at Week 24. This endpoint was assessed initially in the overall study population. If the results for the overall study population were found to be significant, then subsequent analyses were performed to examine treatment effects within the two strata. Second- ary efficacy endpoints included change from baseline in FPG and per cent change from baseline in plasma lipids [total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein choles- terol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipopro- tein cholesterol (HDL-C) and non-HDL-C] at Week 24. Homeostasis model assessment-b cell function (HOMA-b) and the proinsulin/insulin ratio were calculated to assess b-cell function [18,19]. HOMA-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were calculated to assess changes in insulin resistance [18,20].","

","Patients with adequate compliance (!75%) during this placebo run-in period underwent baseline evaluations and were randomized through an IVRS in a 1: 1 ratio to the addition of either once-daily sitagliptin 100 mg or placebo to ongoing stable doses of glimepiride, alone or in combination with metformin.","
